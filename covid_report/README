A script to fetch the covid report using the srf id.
This is particularly helpful for people in karnataka.
Fetches the covid report in intervals (default 120seconds)

The script uses tkinter to display a window to fetch the SRF ID and Retry duration.
A standalone binary is available for windows. Please download the "tesseract" folder and place it in the same folder as that of the executable.

That is, the following should be in the same folder:
covid_report_fetcher-windows.exe
tesseract

The "tesseract" folder will have "tessdata" subfolder and a "tesseract.exe" windows binary.

-rw-r--r--  1 vipin.parthasarathy  staff  4670976 Apr 26 11:10 tesseract.exe

For MacOS, please install tesseract for the binary to work:
"brew install tesseract"

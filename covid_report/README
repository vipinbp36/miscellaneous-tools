A script to fetch the covid report using the srf id.
This is particularly helpful for people in karnataka.
Fetches the covid report in intervals (default 120seconds)

sample command:  python ./covid_report_fetcher.py --srfid <srf-id> --interval 300

Note: I haven't tested this on a windows PC. Works fine on Mac.
